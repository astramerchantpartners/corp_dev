There's a disbalance, in the market where it comes to information who has it and benifts from it also mirror missalocation in terms of funds - low interest rates, savers and small investors who want to benefit from technology growth, also innovative companies pushing the envelope who need the capital. The bottle neck is VCs as information hubs and rent-seekers, banks also can't do debt for structural and risk reasons (tech has no plant, yet - or assets that can be collaterlazid), investment banks are see the space too small, deals are small and there's no technology or infrastructure for syndication and securitization. The problem really comes down to lack of infrastructure (though work is being made to lay pipes for crowdfunding), e/valuation models, and financial products that can be employed by issuing companies to better match their business models and cashflow structures,  - i.e. maybe debt, someone more intimate with employee (compensation) stock option needs, and on investor side - ability to mark to market, have liquidity. In fact liquidity is a major problem here, but with advent of secondary markets there's a ray of hope - at this point - VCs are liquidity takers, they became the defacto market makers for tech companies and also problem is their mandates, they focus on super winners, and allocate capital/bandwidth accordingly (need more here). Additionally, the demand for shares of succesfull later stage tech companies creates the RoFR pump - here outside investors come in and get periodically rejected with ever higher bids on existing stock, RoFR partners (i.e. outside insiders) buy up shares, each new round bids up the existing valuation. This market has attracted it's own players, hedge fund presence is a major sign.
